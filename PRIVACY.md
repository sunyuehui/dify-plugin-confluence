## Privacy Policy

This privacy policy outlines how the Dify Confluence Plugin handles your information when you use it to interact with your Confluence instance.

### Data Collection

The Dify Confluence Plugin requires the following information to function:

1.  **Confluence Credentials:** Your Confluence URL, username (or email), and API token are required to authenticate with your Confluence instance. These credentials are securely stored by Dify's credential management system and are used solely for making API requests to your Confluence instance on your behalf.
2.  **User Inputs:** Data you provide when using the plugin's tools, such as space keys, page titles, page content, page IDs, CQL queries, etc., are collected to perform the requested actions (e.g., creating a page, searching for pages).

### Data Processing

-   **Confluence Credentials:** Your credentials are used exclusively to authenticate API requests sent from the plugin to your Confluence instance. They are not used for any other purpose.
-   **User Inputs:** The data you provide is used to construct API requests to Confluence to perform actions like creating, deleting, retrieving, or listing pages and spaces.

### Third-party Services

This plugin interacts directly with the **Atlassian Confluence API**. Your use of Confluence is subject to Atlassian's privacy policy and terms of service. The plugin acts as an intermediary, sending your requests and data to the Confluence API and returning Confluence's responses. No data is shared with any other third-party services.

### Data Retention

The Dify Confluence Plugin itself does not store your Confluence credentials or user input data persistently. Credentials are managed by the Dify platform. Data related to your interactions (like page details) resides within your Confluence instance and is subject to Confluence's data retention policies. Logs generated by Dify during plugin execution might contain operational data but are handled according to Dify's platform policies.

### User Rights

Your rights regarding the data stored within Confluence (pages, spaces, etc.) are governed by your Confluence instance's settings and Atlassian's policies. You can manage your data directly within Confluence. For data handled by the Dify platform (like stored credentials), please refer to Dify's privacy policy and user settings.

### Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns about the privacy practices of this plugin, please contact the plugin author.
